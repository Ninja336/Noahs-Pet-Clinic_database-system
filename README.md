Problem Statement:
The appointment and registration system at Noah's Pet Clinic (NPC) is currently experiencing several issues that affect both pet owners and clinic employees. These problems include inadequate or erroneous information on registration forms, trouble accessing and retrieving appointment details, and the absence of a centralised database for effective record-keeping. Furthermore, pet owners cannot easily schedule appointments with the current system's unintuitive interface, which could cause annoyance and inefficiency. Moreover, data security issues have been found, emphasising the necessity for improved safeguards to secure pet and owner data. All of these difficulties make it more difficult for the clinic to deliver smooth, effective services, which eventually affects client happiness and overall operational efficacy. Therefore, in order to solve these problems and enhance both the overall experience of pet owners and clinic employees at NPC, it is imperative that the appointment and registration system be upgraded.
